Buffer_Object
=============

A skeleton implementation for using Wayland subsurfaces with Evas image objects
and their Evas_Video_Surface API.

This implementation will configure an image object with the callbacks for show,
hide, move, resize and update_pixels of the Video Surface, using
Ecore_Wl_Subsurf related APIs, which provide Wayland subsurfaces handling.

So far the API is very small, and not so flexible, but it's enough to allow an
application to set a buffer on an image object and let it be handled
automatically by Evas, that will display the surface when possible, or hide it
and use the buffer pixel data to compose it with the rest of the canvas
otherwise.

TODO:
 - better reporting of when the pixel buffer is not "released":
   Currently this reporting is not correct, the point where we can say that a
   wl_buffer is released (using wayland callbacks) is not the same where a
   pixel buffer of the said image is released. Additionally, the pixel buffer
   is used several times (it seems that at least once per frame).

 - Add APIs to configure some other aspects of the subsurface, like the
   capabilities. One might want to change if the subsurface will be placed
   above or below the canvas, or other options if needed.
