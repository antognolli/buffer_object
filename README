Buffer_Object
=============

A skeleton implementation for using Wayland subsurfaces with Evas image objects
and their Evas_Video_Surface API.

This implementation will configure an image object with the callbacks for show,
hide, move, resize and update_pixels of the Video Surface, using
Ecore_Wl_Subsurf related APIs, which provide Wayland subsurfaces handling.

So far the API is very small, and not so flexible, but it's enough to allow an
application to set a buffer on an image object and let it be handled
automatically by Evas, that will display the surface when possible, or hide it
and use the buffer pixel data to compose it with the rest of the canvas
otherwise.

How To Use
==========

Run "make" and the main program should be built. Latest EFL (master) is
required, and Elementary too. Run it with:

 $ ECORE_EVAS_ENGINE="wayland_shm" ./main

It's possible to use "wayland_egl" engine too. If one wants to know when the
subsurface is created and used, instead of the pixel buffer, just set the eina
log levels accordingly:

 $ EINA_LOG_LEVELS="buffer_object:4" ECORE_EVAS_ENGINE="wayland_egl" ./main

This example simulates a video decoded on the pixel buffer. A real video
decoding example should be implemented later.


TODO:
====
 - better reporting of when the pixel buffer is not "released":
   Currently this reporting is not correct, the point where we can say that a
   wl_buffer is released (using wayland callbacks) is not the same where a
   pixel buffer of the said image is released. Additionally, the pixel buffer
   is used several times (it seems that at least once per frame).

 - Add APIs to configure some other aspects of the subsurface, like the
   capabilities. One might want to change if the subsurface will be placed
   above or below the canvas, or other options if needed.
